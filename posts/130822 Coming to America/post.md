I'll be moving to Seattle, Washington with my wife in a couple of weeks as I've accepted a position at [Amazon][1]! I will be joining the [AWS][2] team to work on the [Kindle's][3] cloud-powered browser [Silk][4]. Needless to say I'm super excited to get into it :)

This is the reason for my being a little quiet on the blog recently; organising everything to move overseas. I hope to continue blogging after moving, though probably not quite as much as I have been over the last year. I will also be able to start up my Korean study again which I took a little break from to focus on work stuff.
