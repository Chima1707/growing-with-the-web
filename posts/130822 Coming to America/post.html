<p>I&#39;ll be moving to Seattle, Washington with my wife in a couple of weeks as I&#39;ve accepted a position at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>! I will be joining the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> team to work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle">Kindle&#39;s</a> cloud-powered browser <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Silk">Silk</a>. Needless to say I&#39;m super excited to get into it :)</p>
<p>This is the reason for my being a little quiet on the blog recently; organising everything to move overseas. I hope to continue blogging after moving, though probably not quite as much as I have been over the last year. I will also be able to start up my Korean study again which I took a little break from to focus on work stuff.</p>
